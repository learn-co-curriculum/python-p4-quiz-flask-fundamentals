# Question 3

Why is Flask called a Microframework?

## Correct

It only contains the basics we need for a web application.

> Correct! Microframeworks like Flask handle some basic functionality, but more
> specific duties require extentions **.**

## Incorrect

Flask gives you an ORM, a web server, authentication, and more.&nbsp;

> Not quite. We can extend Flask to include those things using libraries but flask
> does not come with everything we need to create a full stack web
> application.&nbsp;

## Incorrect

I don't know.
