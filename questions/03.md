# Question 4

How do we define a route in flask?

## Correct

```python
@app.route('/route')
def index():
    return 'Welcome to my app!'
```

> Correct! We use the @app.route() decorator.

## Incorrect

```python
def index('/route'):
    return 'Welcome to my app!'
```

> Almost! We don't define the route by adding it as a method parameter.
