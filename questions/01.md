# Question 2

How do we parameterize different parts of our routes?

## Incorrect

```python
@app.route('/username')
def user(username):
    return f'Profile for {username}'
```

> Not quite! Perhaps we can do something with angle brackets `<>`?

## Correct

```python
@app.route('/<username>')
def user(username):
    return f'Profile for {username}'
```

> Correct! We can also define the username type as a string, int, float,
> or path (string with slashes) by specifying this in the route:
>
> `'/<string:username>'`
